## Key Features
Following are some key features this dashboard entails:
**Dynamic Sales Tracking:** Visualizes total sales volume and revenue trends over a four-year period.

**Brand and Regional Analysis:** Interactive slicing by Brand (Apple, Samsung etc.) and Country to drill down into specific market performance. 

**Time-Intelligence Metrics:** Includes Year-Over-Year (YoY) Growth calculations and monthly seasonality trends.

**Distributor Insights:** Identifies top-performing retail partners and distributors (e.g. Tottus, Oeschle)

## Data Insight
**Peak Performance:** The year 2021 saw significant surge in sales volume, nearly doubling the performance of previous years. 

**Seasonality:** Sales data shws high volatility throughout the year, with consistent peaks in Februrary and September. The September surge could be due to the release of the new Apple devices. 

<h2 Technical Higlights h2>
To ensure a professional user interface, I implemented a custom DAX measure to handle data gaps. For example, YOY Sales % measure was optimized to return "Select a Year" value instead of a -100% when no prior year data is available (e.g. for the start year of 2018)
