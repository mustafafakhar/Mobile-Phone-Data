Final Year Project</h1>

This repository includes my final year project where I used python and machine learning to determine and predict the emissons of Scotland using Data Science. 

The main libraries I used include Numpy for numerical analyss, Sci-kit Learn for machine learning models and matplotlib for visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset was available on Scottish Government's offocial website. The dataset dated back to 1990, which provided a good historical data on which the model would be able to learn and provide accurate results.

## Machine Learning Models
The machine learning models used included Linear Regression Model, Random Forest model and Gradient Boosting Model. The selection of the best model was determined based on the scores of each
model and how well they fit to the dataset. For this purpose, I used R-Squared, RMSE and MAE scores. 
From the above models. R-Squared score was the highest for Random Forest Model. Based upon this judgement, the future emissions were determined.
